Goal:  Make baremetal scaleout faster, simpler, and require less technical skills.  The following are the principles of Simplicify (in no particular order):

1.  Code out of love, not hate
2.  Gather metrics for everything
3.  Abstract as much as possible
4.  Do not tolerate lock-in on any level, i.e. storage, provisioners, container engines
5.  Don't Repeat Yourself
6.  Embrace forwards technology, while reluctantly supporting legacy
7.  Write code with good UX in mind, make the UI team's life easy
8.  Do not automatically overwrite
9.  Do not automatically delete
10.  Go to etcd before s3
11.  Provide visibility by default to what is needed, but optionally view under the hood
